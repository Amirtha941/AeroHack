When I first looked at the AeroHack challenge, I honestly felt it was beyond my knowledge. But as always, I choose to face challenges regardless of the outcome. I decided to break it down and give it my best.

I began by carefully analyzing the problem statement. I started learning the basics of drones, especially how they function in complex terrains. Initially, I misunderstood the task — I thought we had to design an entire drone within ₹50,000 and 1.5 kg. Later, I realized that the actual task was to design just the deterrence system, which gave me a clearer direction.

As I researched existing solutions, I noticed most relied on sound, flashing lights, or predator-shaped decoys. These felt repetitive and predictable. That’s when I decided to approach it from my domain — Electronics and Communication Engineering.

I started exploring biologically inspired, sensor-driven systems using IMUs, SDRs, polarization effects, IR modules, and more. Slowly, a modular deterrence system began to take shape in my mind. Each module had its own logic, and together, they worked as a layered, adaptive defense.

I’m truly grateful for this challenge. Over the past week, I’ve spent time every day thinking, researching, simulating, and designing. Each day I realized how differently I had started to think — more systemically, more creatively. This has been one of the most intellectually rewarding challenges I’ve faced.

Huge thanks to the Collins Aerospace team and AeroHack 2025 for giving me an opportunity to discover my true potential.
