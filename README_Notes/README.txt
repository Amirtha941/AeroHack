📌 Running Simulations:

Python files (.ipynb):

Open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Ensure matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy are installed

Run cells to view plots or FFT analyses

MATLAB file (.m):

Open in MATLAB (tested in MATLAB R2024a)

Run Module1_PathDistortion_3D.m to see 3D trajectory distortion

Output: animated path flicker + trajectory visualization

🧾 Notes:

All simulation outputs are verified for feasibility within the drone's power and memory constraints.

GIFs and PNGs are generated from simulation outputs and referenced in slides.

The solution is weather-resilient, biologically inspired, and fits within the cost (₹50,000) and weight (1.5 kg) limits.

Visual design and module layout are done for maximum clarity for the judging panel.
